# My Configuration for Home Assistant

Within this repository I'm sharing my Home Assistant configuration.

### Noteworthy stuff
- FRITZ!Box Guest Wifi Control (custom_component)
- Turn 15â‚¬ coffee machine on when the alarm clock rings (using Sleep As Android and a Wifi switch)
- Turn on bedroom lights 15m before my alarm starts (using Tasker and Sleep As Android)
- 23 Automations in total
- WIP: Voice control everything via DIY Amazon Echo (using Dialogflow)
